<p>Here's a little bit about my experience. I was born. Then, after that, a bunch of stuff happened; I went to school, then I went to school again. I got a degree. More stuff happened. I listened to alot of music, wasted alot of time watching television, and then finally decided to become a front end developer.</p>
