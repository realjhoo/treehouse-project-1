        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Most of the placeholder text applies to me. I do want to be a front end developer, I do enjoy the internet, I have indeed lived in various cities, and I am excited to bring my experience to front end development.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a non-profit executive, a teacher and an adjunct professor. I've probably done some other stuff, too... but you don't need to know everything.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript and use them to build websites. I would also like to learn some back end in the future. Here's that same information, in list form: </p>

        <h2>The History of Friday</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, there were only six days in the week. In those days, Saturday was right after Thursday. After work on Thursdays, people weren't sure if they were supposed to work the next day or not. It was causing alot of confusion. The invention of Friday solved these issues.</p>
        <p>Seriously. It totally happened like that.</p>
